# K-Means-and-Auto-Encoder
The task of the project is to perform unsupervised learning on Cifar 10 dataset. There are two task, the first is to perform K-means clustering on the raw data from scratch. The second is to perform K-means clustering on a representation generated by the Auto-Encoder method using library functions. The code should be written in Python using Keras.
